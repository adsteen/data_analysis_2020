      <description>Style is substance Donald Knuth famously wrote “Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.” (Knuth, 1983, Literate Programming).
Accordingly, it is important to write our code so that it is easily readable by humans. What defines easily readable? Well, it helps for the whole community of readers to be working from a common set of rules.</description>

      <description>Help on specific functions Every function in R has a an associated documentaion file. In RStudio, typing the name of the function, prefaced by ?, will pull up the documentation for that function. For instance, try ?sum[On my machine, RStudio sometimes gets over-excited about auto-completing and tries to fill in the name of a longer function. Just type backspace when that happens.] (you don’t need the ()): in the lower-right-hand panel of RStudio you’ll see a documentation displayed.</description>

      <title>Intro to packages</title>

      <description>Like all programming languages, R relies on a base language, which is extended by packages. When you installed R, you only installed the base language1. However, base R can only do so much.
Most of R’s power lies is in its packages. Need to do timeseries forecasting? You’ll want the forecast package. Need to do multivariate statistics? vegan is world-leading. Currently there are more than 16,000 packages listed on CRAN for basically every task you can imagine.</description>

      <description>to be updated
 This week has a bunch of R basics. Chapters 1 and 4 of R for Data Science are a good place to start. However, I would like you all to practice your Git/Github skills by adding introductory references to this list.  To do that:
 Go to https://github.com/adsteen/490_site_source, which contains the source code for this website Press the “Fork” link to make a copy of that Git “repo” (repository) On your version of this repository on the GitHub website (it’ll be labeled your-user-name/490_site_source, navigate to contents/resources/2020-09-08-Week_02-resources.</description>
