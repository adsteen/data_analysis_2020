* The RStudio list of [cheat sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). The Data Import, Data Transformation, Data Visualization, and RStudio IDE cheat sheets will be particularly valuable to you.
* R for Data Science [Chapter 3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)
* Hadley Wickham on [Tidy data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). Note that this old-ish  paper uses the syntax of a package called **plyr**, which is a bit different from the tidyverse counterpart called **dplyr**.
