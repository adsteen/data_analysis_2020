Expands on the idea of [split-apply-combine](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i01) and how to use the **dplyr** package.

<!--more-->

We've discussed how to do some basics in R: create scripts, add numbers, make simple plots. In this lesson, we begin working with **dplyr**, the package for performing split-apply-combine operations on data frames which is at heart of the tidyverse.

For this lesson, we'll use the `flights` data set in the **nycflights13** package. As usual, we'll install it (once) with `install.packages("nycflights13")` and load it (each time we open RStudio) using `library(nycflights13)`. 

First let's get a sense of the structure of `flights`:

```{r intro}
